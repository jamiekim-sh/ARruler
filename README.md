## ARruler
When you don't have a physical ruler... This ruler measures real world distances for you! 

## Framework 
ARKit 

SceneKit 

## Goal 
Add nodes where we want to measure 

Detect 2D coordinates to measure real world distances in AR; Create 3D objects and text in AR 

## Note 
To reduce the size of the file, I had to cut the video about 20 seconds short. 

Measurement is in cm. (13.3 inch = 33.78 cm) 

This is a screen recorded demo using my iOS device!

As you see Agumented Reality is pretty awesome!
